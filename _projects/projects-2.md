In this paper, we present an end-to-end autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network (AMINN) for the prediction
of survival outcomes in multifocal CRLM patients using radiomic features extracted from contrast-enhanced MRIs. 
Specifically, we jointly train an autoencoder to reconstruct input features and a multiple instance network to make 
predictions by aggregating information from all tumour lesions of a patient.
